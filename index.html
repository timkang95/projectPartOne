               Hello! Welcome to my personal website! This is <br>
               mainly professional though I would like to devote<br>
               the homepage about Timothy Kang, the person.

               I am an avid runner. I ran cross country and track<br>
               through my entire high school career. I continued<br>
               running to keep up my endurance and fitness level.<br>
               I do believe exercise will lead to a better and <br>
               happy life.

               I like to maintain my activity through hobbies<br>
               such as skiing. I also like to longboard, sliding<br>
               down hills seems like a common activity. Aside<br>
               from that, I love to play soccer and watch<br>
               Philadelphia in MLS.

             <p>
               I also love to play music. I play many instruments<br>
               from bass guitar to piano. Sometimes I love just<br>
               listening to tunes. My favorite bands have to be <br>
               Arctic Monkey and The Black Keys.
